## SEB - COMPUTING POWER

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to compute the power of a given number using an appropriate built-in function.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Input the base number (`base`) from the user.  
3. Input the exponent number (`exp`) from the user.  
4. Use the built-in `pow()` function to compute the base raised to the power of the exponent.  
5. Print the result using the `print()` function, displaying the power in a formatted output.  
6. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
# Reg.No: 212223060057
# Name: DINESH KUMAR A
# Write your code here

# Taking input from user
base = float(input("Enter the base number: "))
exp = float(input("Enter the exponent number: "))

# Computing power using built-in function
result = pow(base, exp)

# Displaying result
print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exp} is {result}")

```
### OUTPUT
```
Enter the base number: 3
Enter the exponent number: 4
3.0 raised to the power of 4.0 is 81.0

```

### RESULT
Thus, the Python program to compute the power of a given number using the pow() built-in function was successfully implemented and executed.
