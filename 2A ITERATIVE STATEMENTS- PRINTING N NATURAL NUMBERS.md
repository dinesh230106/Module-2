## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS – PRINTING N NATURAL NUMBERS

###  Aim
To create a Python program for printing `n` natural numbers using a `for` loop.

---

###  Algorithm

1. Begin the program.
2. Use `input()` to read the value of `n` (the upper limit) from the user.
3. Convert the input to an integer.
4. Display the message **"Natural Numbers are :"**.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
6. In each iteration, print the current value of `i`.
7. Terminate the program.

### 🧾 Program

```python
# Reg.No:212223060057
# Name:DINESH KUMAR A
# Write your code here

n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))

print("Natural Numbers are:")
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(i)


```
### OUTPUT
```
Enter the value of n: 5
Natural Numbers are:
1
2
3
4
5

```
### RESULT
Thus, the Python program to print n natural numbers using a for loop was successfully implemented and executed.
